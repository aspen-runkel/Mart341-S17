    <h1>OH, THE PLACES YOU'LL GO!</h1>
    <h2>by Dr. Seuss</h2>
    <p>
    You have brains in your head.<br />
    You have feet in your shoes.<br />
    You can steer yourself<br />
    Any direction you choose.<br />
    You’re on your own. And <br />
    you know what you know.<br />
    And YOU are the guy who’ll<br />
    decide where to go.<br />
    <br />
    You’ll get mixed up,<br />
    of course, as you already know.<br />
    You’ll get mixed up with<br />
    many strange birds as you go.<br />
    So be sure when you step.<br />
    Step with care and great<br />
    tact and remember that<br />
    Life’s A Great Balancing Act.<br />
    <br />
    And will you succeed?<br />
    Yes! You will, indeed!<br />
    (98 and ¾ percent guaranteed.)<br />
    <br />
    KID, YOU’LL MOVE <br />
    MOUNTAINS!<br />
