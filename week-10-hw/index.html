        <h2>What is responsive web design?</h2>
        <p>Responsive web design makes your web page look and work well on all devices including desktops, laptops, tablets, and phones.  Responsive web design is about using HTML and CSS to resize, hide, shrink, enlarge, or move the content to make it look good on any screen.  Responsive web design is a design strategy that emphasizes "mobile first, unobtrusive javascript, and progressive enhancement."</p>
        <p>An example of responsive web design is when the content reflows to fit the smaller viewport when you are on a smaller screen or make the window smaller.</p>

        <h2>Why is responsive web design important?</h2>
        <p>A web page should look good and be easy to use regardless of the device.  There is a wealth of technology out there all with different screen sizes that people use to view all kinds of webpages.  If a webpage does not utilize responsive web design and therefore does not look good and be easy to use, the users will likely leave the website. To drive this idea home, mobile traffic now accounts for more than half of total internet traffic.</p>

        <h2>How do you test your site to make sure it is responsive across all devices?</h2>
        <p>It is important to be able to test if your site is responsive on many devices to ensure you don't lose users who may be using particular devices that it is unresponsive on.  It is uneconomical to gather all possible devices and physically test you site on each of them.  An alternative solution is to use a simulator or emulator.  Although they are not always 100% accruate, they are great tools that most often get the job done.</p>
        <p><strong>emulator</strong>: a hardware or software that enables one computer system to behave like another computer system.</p>
        <p><strong>simulator</strong>: a system with a similar set of controls designed to provide a realistic imitation of the operation of another system.</p>
