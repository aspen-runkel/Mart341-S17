1. <strong>Overview:</strong> <br />
This homework cycle was a lot of fun. Parallax sites are super cool and modern, and I really enjoyed being able to build one myself. <br />
<br />

2. <strong>Steps taken to complete the assignment:</strong> <br />
I started by taking a look at the requirements for this week's assignment before going through the week 11 material. This allowed me to keep the requirements of the assignment in mind while going through the material so I could pay attention to and think about how I was going to put it to use. <br />
<br /> I started the actual assignment by  setting up my directory. I then completed my html document using the textbook as a reference and course website.  After verifying that I included the proper tags and elements to style my document with css, I moved onto the css document.<br />
<br />To complete the css document, I went through the assignment requirements and material again very methodically to try and ensure that I included everything and did it properly.  The course website proved to be VERY helpful and I used it as a guide.<br/>
<br />When selecting my colors, I chose colors that were fitting for my theme - Glacier National Park - and were easy to read, etc.  When selecting my font, I choose a simple font with a little bit of character that I felt fit my theme.<br />
<br />

3. <strong>Problems</strong> <br />
We were provided with such great resources, that this homework cycle went with very little problems.  Unfortunately, my biggest problem was that I was unable to get the assignment in on time.  I got behind and overwhelmed with the homework from week 10 which in turn put me behind on this assignment.<br />
<br />

4. <strong>Moving forward</strong> <br />
I think I am going to use this theme for my final website.  I will review the course material and have already began the initial steps of building my final website. <br />
