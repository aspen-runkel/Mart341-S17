1. **Summarize the work you did this homework cycle. Paying particular attention to the individual choices you made.**
This homework cycle, we dived into HTML (HyperText Markup Language).  The course website and [Jon Duckett's book](https://www.amazon.com/HTML-CSS-Design-Build-Websites/dp/1118008189) were inviting and easy to take in which made learning the basics of HTML enjoyable and interesting.  Something I thought was interesting was that extra spaces and lines are not recognized on the rendered HTML without the proper *tags*. Althought the pre-formatted text element may be useful and avoiding the sometimes cumberson process of making sure it is formatted how you wish, I was't sure I liked how the final rendering ended up in the example.  I imagine I will need to continue referencing the content we covered on this section regularly, but I am confident that it will get easier with practice.

2. **What steps did you take to complete the assignment?**
I followed the steps layed out on the [course website](https://montana-media-arts.github.io/mart341-webDev/modules/week-3/overview/) closely making sure to pay special attention to details.  This week was pretty straight forward after completing last weeks assignment and content.

3. **Did you have any problems or issues? How did you solve these? Did you post about these to the class repo issue tracker? Did you receive any useful feedback from your classmates?**
The only problem I had was with step 8 of the [Going Live](https://montana-media-arts.github.io/mart341-webDev/modules/week-3/GoingLive/) section.  After getting confirmation from GitHub that my site was published at ```https://aspen-runkel.github.io/mart341-S17/```, I added ```week-03-hw/``` to the end of this address and did not have success.  I proceeded to commit and push the changes made to my index.html file, and the adjusted link worked them.  I almost posted this issue to the forum before getting it figured out myself.  I think this is a step that was implied but not explicitely stated in the steps.


4. **Is there anything in particular you learned that you would like to discuss further?**
As I mentioned earlier, I imagine I will need to continue referencing the content we covered on this section regularly, but I am confident that it will get easier with practice.


5. **What issues did you help your fellow classmates out with this past homework cycle?**
I responded to Kate Cier's issue titled [Week 3 SourceTree Issue](https://github.com/Montana-Media-Arts/341-work/issues/16) thinking her issue was the same or similar to the issue I had and explained what I did to get it straigtened out.
