1. **Overview:** <br />
This homework cycle <br />
<br />
2. **Steps taken to complete the assignment** <br />
Unlike most homework cycles, I took in the material in much smaller intervals which was **very** beneficial - especially considering the extent of content included in week 7 and 8.  I started by going through the week 7 material and then read the assignment requirements before starting on the week 8 material.  This turned out to be a very good decision because the week 7 material gave me a background on the material so I understood what the assignment was asking and allowed me to keep the requirements of the assignment in mind while going through the remainder of the material. <br />
<br /> I started the actual assignment by  setting up my directory. I then completing my html document using the textbook as a reference and a piece of writing I recently completed in a story format.  After verifying that I included the proper tags and elements to style my document with css including ```<span></span>, <div id=""></div>, etc.```, I moved onto the css document.  To complete the css document, I went through the assignment requirements and material again very methodically to ensure that I included everything and did it properly.  This process helped me minimize the amount of backtracking I needed to do and made the assignment much more doable. <br />
<br />
3. **Problems** <br />
Overall, my experience this homework cycle was positive. The process I took to complete the assignment proved to be the key to my success.  The course material and textbook both proved to be valuable resources.  I'd recommend my peers to take advantage of these resources and be methodical with the process.  It makes the tedious process much easier to accomplish with minimal stress and brain cramps. <br />
<br />
4. **Moving forward** <br />
This material has been very exciting to me. It's great to be able to make our websites look more appealing, and I look forward to learning more css. <br />
