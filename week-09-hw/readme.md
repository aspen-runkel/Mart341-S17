1. <strong>Overview:</strong> <br />
This homework cycle do not go as well for me.  I had a good experience with the introduction to css but struggled a lot with the specifics from this homework cycle.<br />
<br />
2. <strong>Steps taken to complete the assignment</strong> <br />
I started by taking a look at the requirements for this week's assignment before going through the week 9 material. This allowed me to keep the requirements of the assignment in mind while going through the material so I could pay attention to and think about how I was going to put it to use. <br />
<br /> I started the actual assignment by  setting up my directory. I then completing my html document using the textbook as a reference and a cookbook for inspiration.  After verifying that I included the proper tags and elements to style my document with css, I moved onto the css document.<br />
<br />When selecting my colors, I chose colors that were vibrant and related to food.  In this case, the colors are colors of bell peppers.  When selecting my fonts, I choose a simple font with a little bit of character for the bulk of my text and a fancier font for the name of my webpage.<br />
<br />To complete the css document, I went through the assignment requirements and material again very methodically to try and ensure that I included everything and did it properly.  Unfortunately, I faced some issues that I was unable to figure out. <br />
<br />
3. <strong>Problems</strong> <br />
As you will see when you take a look at my live website, I had troubles with either the positioning or height styling.  I spent multiple hours playing with it, reviewing the textbook and course site, and eventually ran out of time and had to let it rest.  If you could take a look at my html and css and help me determine how to fix this, I would love your input.  Otherwise, I was going for two-collumns with the recipe ingredients and directions in the left collumn and the "chef bio" in the right collumn.  I wanted the orange footer to go at the bottom of this and the border to encompass all elements of the webpage.<br />
<br />
4. <strong>Moving forward</strong> <br />
I am going to work on understanding the styling discussed this homework cycle.  It didn't seem as difficult in theory but I really struggled with it in practice and plan to seek out help earlier in the process before I run out of time. <br />
