1. **Summarize the work you did this homework cycle. Paying particular attention to the individual choices you made.** <br />
This homework cycle was a *flood* of information that was a bit overwhelming at first.  After working through building a questionaire, the content feels more comfortable but there is still a lot of information that is pretty foreign.  For instance, the table content wasn't utilized in our assignment unless you went out of your way to put it in your questionaire.  It didn't seem to belong.  This being said, I didn't spend much time practicing the table content.  I worked throught the questionaire from top to bottom.

2. **What steps did you take to complete the assignment?** <br />
I started out by brainstorming what the topic of my questionaire was going to be.  I decided on a UM student questionaire because it is relevant to us.  As I do with most of my assignments, I went on to setting up the basic format of the html document including the first fieldset. <br />

After setting up the basic format, I worked through the form elements in the textbook to assemble the questions.  After coding all my questions, I went through the homework requirements and checked to make sure I had all the other elements.

3. **Did you have any problems or issues? How did you solve these?** <br />
I had a few issues with various form elements not working properly after first review.  I resolved these by tediously examining the html in relation to the textbook and other resources.

4. **Is there anything in particular you learned that you would like to discuss further?** <br />
I would like to spend more time with the html from this homework cycle considering there was *soooooooo* much of it.
