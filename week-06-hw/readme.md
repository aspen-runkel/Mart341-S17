1. **Summarize the work you did this homework cycle. Paying particular attention to the individual choices you made.** <br />
This homework cycle was a lot of work, but it helped bring in all the HTML we have learned. I went throught the course material, read through the requirements, and then completed my website systematically.

2. **What steps did you take to complete the assignment?** <br />
I started out by brainstorming the topic of my website.  After taking a look at the requirements and noticing that we needed a video with our own copyright, I started to think of what I could video.  I was cooking quesadillas for dinner, so that happened to be the subject of my website.  As I do with most of my assignments, I went on to setting up the basic format of the html document.  After setting up the basic format, I copied the relevant elements to my other pages and adjusted the content to satisfy the requirements. 

3. **Did you have any problems or issues? How did you solve these?** <br />
I had a issues uploading the video I had filmed preparing a quesadilla as a .mp4 file, so I decided to upload it to youtube and then embed it into my site that way.
